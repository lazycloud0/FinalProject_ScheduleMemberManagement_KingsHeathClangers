<h2 align="center">Who we are</h2>
<p align="left">Syntax Squad is a School of Code team who came together in the final four weeks of their bootcamp to plan, build and deploy a solution to a real-world problem posed by their stakeholder, King's Heath Community Basketball Club. <br>
 <br> After learning that the current method of scheduling games/training was a low-tech groupchat polling system, Syntax Squad explored potential solutions by conducting research, and the idea for King's Heath Clangers' scheduling application was founded. It would be able to improve the booking process for players whilst simultaneously giving easy access to coaches/admin staff to schedule new games.

This fantastic team was made up by the following developers:

Albert Szupszynski<br>
Ayodimeji Akinbolude<br>
Kelsey Baker<br>
Jose Luis Quinones Castro<br>
Winnie Lau<br>
Jules Smith</p>
